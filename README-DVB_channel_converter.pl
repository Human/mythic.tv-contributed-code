Deprecated.  Do NOT use this unless you're using an ancient version of MythTV or KnoppMyth and have a specific problem that you were told is fixed by DVB_fixer.sh or DVB_channel_converter.pl.

If you do need to use them, copy DVB_fixer.sh and DVB_channel_converter.pl to /usr/local/bin/ on your MythTV box.
Run "chmod a+x" on them to make them executable.
Run "DVB_fixer.sh -help" for further help on how to use.
